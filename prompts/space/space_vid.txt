The camera maintains the rover’s first-person perspective, showing its robotic arm moving methodically toward the target rock. \
Hydraulic joints pivot smoothly, causing the drill head to descend with precise, mechanical steadiness. \
As the drill contacts the rock, tiny particles of reddish dust scatter and drift outward in slow motion under the planet’s weaker gravity. \
The arm retracts slightly, rotates, and positions a sample container beneath the drilled fragment. \
Grains of soil slide and settle in delicate arcs, following realistic Martian physics. \
In the background, the landscape remains motionless except for a faint dust haze that occasionally curls along the surface, hinting at a gentle breeze. \
Sunlight glints intermittently off the rover’s metallic components as the sequence progresses, each movement crisp and deliberate, capturing the meticulous \
process of extraterrestrial sample collection.
